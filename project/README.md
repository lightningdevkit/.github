## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Lightning Development Kit (LDK) is a generic library which allows you to build a lightning node without needing to worry about getting all of the lightning state machine, routing, and on-chain punishment code (and other chain interactions) exactly correct.

LDK is based on [Rust-Lightning](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning), a full-featured but also incredibly flexible lightning implementation, allowing the user to decide how they wish to use it.

Learn how to start adding Lightning to your apps at [lightningdev.org](https://lightningdevkit.org/)

### ðŸ”¨ Contributing to the ecosystem
We contribute to [Rust-Lightning](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning), which we rely on to build and run LDK, while also maintaining a number of our own open source projects like:
 - [LDK C Bindings](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-c-bindings) - Main LDK C bindings on which other bindings are built
 - [LDK Garbage Collected](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-garbagecollected) - LDK bindings for garbage-collected languages e.g Java
 - [LDK Swift](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-swift) - LDK Swift bindings for iOS
 - [LDK Sample](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample) - Sample node implementation using LDK
 - [LDK Documentation](lightningdevkit.org) - Our open source documentation

### ðŸ˜ƒ Join our community
Open source is fundamental to this project and we would love to connect with you.

Most of our communication is happening in the LDK [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/lightningdevkit/shared_invite/zt-tte36cb7-r5f41MDn3ObFtDu~N9dCrQ), come say hi!
