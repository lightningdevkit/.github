## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Lightning Development Kit (LDK) is a library that allows you to build a lightning node without worrying about implementing low-level lightning logic correctly.

LDK is based on [Rust-Lightning](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning), a full-featured but also incredibly flexible lightning implementation, allowing you to decide how to use it.

Learn how to start adding Lightning to your apps at [lightningdevkit.org](https://lightningdevkit.org/)

### ðŸ”¨ Contributing to the ecosystem
Our team maintains [Rust-Lightning](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning), which we rely on to build and run LDK, while also maintaining a number of other open source projects like:
 - [LDK Node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node) - A ready-to-go Lightning node library built using LDK and BDK
 - [LDK C Bindings](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-c-bindings) - Main LDK C bindings on which other bindings are built
 - [LDK Garbage Collected](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-garbagecollected) - LDK bindings for garbage-collected languages e.g Java
 - [LDK Swift](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-swift) - LDK Swift bindings for iOS
 - [LDK Sample](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-sample) - Sample node implementation using LDK
 - [LDK Documentation](https://lightningdevkit.org/) - Our open source documentation

### ðŸ˜ƒ Join our community
Open source is fundamental to this project and we would love to connect with you.
